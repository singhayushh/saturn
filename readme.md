## History

Saturn's journey was marked by a unique turning point:

- **Summer 2023**: Our initial proposal to develop Saturn within the company was met with rejection. While it was disheartening at first, this setback fueled our determination to build something meaningful.
- **Fall 2023**: Undeterred by the rejection, we decided to pursue Saturn as a personal venture, believing in its potential to serve a broader community of users.
- **Winter 2023**: Today, Saturn stands as a testament to our rebellion against rejection. We have turned adversity into opportunity, and we invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we continue to enhance and expand Saturn for users worldwide.
